This GitHub organisation hosts material related to **LASCON 2026** (Latin American School on Computational Neuroscience).

The repositories here include lecture materials, tutorials, example code, and supporting resources used during the school. The content reflects the state of the software and methodologies at the time of the 2026 edition.

## About LASCON

LASCON is a summer school focused on computational neuroscience, covering topics such as neural modelling, simulation, data analysis, and theoretical approaches to brain function. The school brings together students and lecturers from neuroscience, physics, mathematics, engineering, and related fields.

## Repository Structure

Each repository typically corresponds to a lecture, tutorial, or theme covered during the school. Individual repositories may contain:

- Slides and lecture notes  
- Tutorial notebooks and scripts  
- Example models and simulations  
- Installation notes or dependencies specific to that tutorial  

Please refer to the README of each repository for details and instructions.

## Software and Compatibility

The software used in LASCON 2026 reflects the tools and versions available at the time. Some repositories may rely on deprecated libraries or older APIs, and running the code on modern systems may require adjustments.

To simplify software setup and improve reproducibility, a virtual machine (VM) image with the LASCON software stack preinstalled is available. This is the recommended way to run the tutorials and example code.

To use the VM, first install VirtualBox:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Then download the VM image from the Brazilian Research and Education Network (RNP):
https://filesender.rnp.br/?s=download&token=9df93f05-de2e-4d94-9cca-703b1f160263

The VM is supported on x86_64 systems only. Apple Macs with Apple Silicon processors (M1/M2/M3 and newer) are not supported. Intel or AMD-based machines should work.

Where relevant, additional notes or workarounds are included in individual repositories.

## Intended Audience

This material is primarily intended for:

- Participants of LASCON 2026  
- Researchers and students interested in computational neuroscience  
- Anyone looking for historical examples of modelling and simulation workflows used at the school  

## Licence

Unless otherwise stated, materials are shared for educational and research purposes. Please check individual repositories for licence information and attribution requirements.

## Contact

For general information about LASCON, please refer to the [official school website](https://sisne.org/en/lascon-x/) or contact the organisers of the corresponding edition.
